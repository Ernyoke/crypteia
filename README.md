# Crypteia

## Lambda Extension for Secure SSM Parameters as Environment Variables

To-Do List:

- Huge thanks to this guy! https://github.com/jakejscott/rust-parameters-lambda-extension/issues/1
- Ensure lambda lifecycle events correct. Witnessed shutdown errors. Maybe we need some invoke hook to make sure SSM finished work?
- Make sure dev containers work locally with VS Code Remote Development. Add docs below.
- Set raw environment variables.
- Maybe rename to something like cold environments?

## Development Environment

Using Codespaces or VS Code Remote Containers...
